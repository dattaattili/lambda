Lambda Overview
AWS Lambda is an event-driven, serverless computing platform provided by Amazon as a part of the Amazon Web Services. It is a compute service that runs code in response to events and automatically manages the compute resources required by that code.

AWS Lambda Service is integrated with several other AWS services to support the application code functionality.
with Lambda we can run code for virtually any type of application or backend service - all with zero administration.
Benefits of Serverless compute
No servers to manage - Just write the code and upload it to lambda
Continuous Scaling - Scaled your application in response to each trigger
Subsecond Metering - you are charged for every 100ms your code executes and the number of times your code is triggered.
